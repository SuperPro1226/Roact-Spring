# Introduction

<b>roact-spring</b> is a modern spring-physics based animation library for Roact inspired by react-spring. Instead of fixed durations, it uses physical properties like mass and tension to enable fluid and natural animations.

This library represents a modern approach to animation. It is the perfect bridge between declarative and imperative animations. It takes the best of both worlds and packs them into one flexible library.

## Installation

Add the latest version of roact-spring to your wally.toml (e.g., `RoactSpring = "chriscerie/roact-spring@^0.0"`)
